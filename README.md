## Overview ##

[Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) is a visual programming environment developed by Google that allows users to create code using drag-and-drop "Lego"-like blocks. It is designed to simplify coding by abstracting away the syntax, making it accessible for beginners and educational purposes.
