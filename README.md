## Overview ##

AI agents are "cool" these days and can be found at many places - but for most of us, they are basically "black boxes" which do not reveal how they work internally.

[Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) is a visual programming environment developed by Google that allows users to create code using drag-and-drop "Lego"-like blocks. It is designed to simplify coding by abstracting away the syntax, making it accessible for beginners and educational purposes.

By combining these two technologies, the "blockly-ai-agent" offers beginners and casual programmers an easy way to play and experiment with their own AI agents!
